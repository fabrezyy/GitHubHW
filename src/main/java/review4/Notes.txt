Loops:
    Loops help us repeat a block of code until a condition fails. There are 4 main types of loops in java.
    1)While loop
    2)Do While loop
    3)For Loop
    4)Enhanced for loops
While loop:
    When we don't know the number of iterations beforehand while loop is the best type of loop to use in that scenario.
    For example when we are searching for a product from amazon we keep on clicking the next button until we find it.
Do While loop:
    When we want to execute the body of the loop at least once before we check the condition that's when we should be
    using the do while loop.
For While Loop:
    For is better choice when we know the number of iterations in advance. For example, we want to print 10 numbers.
Array:
    Array is a collection of multiple variables. Every variable is given a number as index that we can use to access
    that variable.
