Difference between print and println
What are variables?
  Variables are like containers that we use to store date in our programs.
What are DataTypes?
  DataTypes are used to store and indentify different types of data in variables.
Primitive datatables:
 There are eight basic datatypes in java.
 Byte= extra small whole number box
 Short= small whole number box
 Int= medium
 Long= extra large
 Float= small container for decimal numbers
 Double= medium container for decimal numbers
 Char= smallest datatype for storing the characters. Single character.
 Boolean= store true or false.
Non-primitive dataTypes.
  Are advance datatypes built using the above mentioned 8 primitive datatypes.
=================================================================================
How do we decide what data type we should use for a variable?
 we decide based on two things one is what type of data we are planning to store and second what type of operations we will be performing on that data.
What are naming conventions in java:
 1) For variables we use camelCase
 2) For class names we use PascalCase
 3) For packages they are always in lowercase.
