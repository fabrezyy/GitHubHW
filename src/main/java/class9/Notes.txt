Arrays:
    Arrays are collections of multiple variables. These variables have indexes which help us retrive and store data
    inside the array.
Why should we use Arrays:
    When we have a lot of data storing it inside variables is not feasible.
Syntax:
  Approach 1:
    Datatype [] ArrayName= int[5];
    int [] numbers=new int[5];
  Approach 2:
    Datatype [] ArrayName={ element1,element2.element3,element4}
    int [] numbers={10,20,30,45,50};

Enhanced for loop:
    Enhanced for loop is a simplified version of normal for loop where the elements are pulled from the array
    automatically 1 by 1. There is no index involved in this type of loop.

Nested Loops:
    Nested Loop is a loop inside another loop.

Why do we need Nested Loops?
