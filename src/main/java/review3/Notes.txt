Scanner Class in java:
 Scanner is a class just like the classes that we create. but it is specially designed so that others can use it.
 This class has a lot of methods which can help us take the input from the keyboard.

Logical Operators:
 Help us combine multiple conditions. There are 3 logical operators in java.
 OR (||)
 NOT (!)
 AND (&&)
NOT(!):
 Reverses the condition if something is true it will make it false, if something is false it will make it true.
OR(||):
 Logical OR helps us to combine multiple boolean conditions in a way that when one condition is true the overall result
 is a true.
AND(&&):
 Helps us combine the conditions in a way that we only get an overall true when all the conditions are true.

Loop:
 Loop helps us repeat a block of code as long as the condition is true. We have while do while and we have for loop.
Why should we use loops:
 Loops help us reduce duplicate code.
When should we use the while loop:
 When we don't know the number of iterations in advance its better we use a while loop.
 For loop is better when we know the number of iterations in advance.


When should we use switch statements:
