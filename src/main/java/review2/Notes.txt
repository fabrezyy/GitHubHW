Type casting:
 Type casting is moving the data from one data type to another.
 When we move something from a small data type to a large data type. It's called auto/widening /implicit.
 When we move something from a bigger box to a smaller box it is called Manual/narrowing/explicit.
Data Types from smaller to large:
 1)byte
 2)short
 3)int
 4)long
 5)float
 6)double
byte(data type)number(variable)
When should we use type casting?
 When we combine the code from different sources we might need to perform this type casting to make the code compatible.
Relational operators:
 Relational operators help us compare data. They always return results in the form of either a true or false.
 == if something is same. returns true
 != if something is not the same. returns true
 > if the value on left side is greater than right side. returns true
 < if the value on left side is smaller than right side. returns true
 >= if the value on the left side is greater or equal than right side returns true
 <= if the value on the left side is smaller or equal than right side returns true

If Statements:
 If statements help the computer to execute the code conditionally.
 Without if conditions almost all the programs will be useless. They will not be able to take any divisions.
 There are many variations of these statements.
 If statements
 If else statements
 Else if statements
 Nested if statements

If statements.
 one condition one action.
If else statements.
 one condition two actions.
If else if statements.
 Multiple conditions multiple actions.
Nested if:
 When one condition is dependent on another condition that's when we use nested if statements.
